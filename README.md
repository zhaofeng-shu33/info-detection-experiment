# Overview

This experiment focuses on comparing the detection results of info-detection with other methods on artificial and real-world dataset.

To replicate the experiment, you should use `python3` and follow steps below:
1. `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`
1. run `python3 demo.py` to generate the boundary curve figure.
1. run `python3 schema.py` to generate result LaTeX table in build directory.
We use `sacred` library to organize our experiment. If proper environment variable is set, the result can be saved to mongo database for further reference.

Result (automatically generated by CICD):
